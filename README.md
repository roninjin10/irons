# irons

`irons` is a CLI tool for spinning up egress-secured cloud VMs (sandboxes) designed for use with AI agents. It lets you create isolated, SSH-accessible environments with fine-grained control over outbound network traffic.

## Get Access

**We're currently in early access.** [Schedule a call →](https://cal.com/matthew-slipper-ironcd/15min) and we'll get you set up with API keys in 15 minutes.

## Installation

### Install Script (recommended)

```sh
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ironsh/irons/main/install.sh | bash
```

### Download Binary

Pre-built binaries for macOS and Linux are available on the [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/ironsh/irons/releases/latest) page.

### From Source

Requires Go 1.24+.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/ironsh/irons.git
cd irons
go install github.com/ironsh/irons@latest
```

## Authentication

Log in once with your IronCD account:

```sh
irons login
```

This opens a browser-based authorization flow and saves your API token to `~/.config/irons/config.yml`. All subsequent commands will use it automatically.

You can also supply your key via the `IRONS_API_KEY` environment variable or the `--api-key` flag, which take precedence over the config file.

## Quick Start

```sh
# Log in
irons login

# Create a sandbox and wait until it's ready
irons create my-sandbox

# SSH in
irons ssh my-sandbox

# Tear it down when done
irons destroy my-sandbox
```

Commands accept either a sandbox **name** or its **VM ID** (e.g. `vm_abc123`) — whichever is more convenient.

## Claude Code Skill

This repo includes a [Claude Code skill](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/skills) that teaches Claude how to use irons. To add it to another project:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/roninjin10/irons.git ~/.irons
```

Then add it to your project's `.claude/settings.json`:

```json
{
  "skills": [
    "~/.irons/.claude/skills/irons"
  ]
}
```

Claude Code will now have full knowledge of irons commands, egress configuration, and the REST API when working in that project.

## Documentation

Full command reference, egress configuration, and guides are at **[docs.iron.sh](https://docs.iron.sh)**.
